# Solubility Predictor ML Project

## Description
This project demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring a dataset using **Pandas**.
- Separate features (`X`) and target variable (`y`) for modeling.
- Building and evaluating a simple machine learning model.

The dataset used is from [Data Professor](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data), specifically the **Delaney solubility dataset**, which predicts the solubility of molecules based on their chemical descriptors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
